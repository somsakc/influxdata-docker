# Porting Cloned Influxdb

This porting is to convert Dockerfile for use Influxdb on Raspberri Pi platform (armhf). Initially, I prioritied to focus InfluxDB version 1.2 on Raspberri Pi Model B+ initially. I have built it on my board and did run test preliminary.

I use other armhf/debian:jessie (https://hub.docker.com/r/armhf/debian/) as starting image to build InfluxDB image.

Here is some output as I captured.
```
